# Node Integrations

## 1. Setup

You will need a few prerequisites before you can run this repository.

1. Download the latest version of NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
2. Download the TIBCOÂ® Cloud - Command Line Interface from https://integration.cloud.tibco.com/download.
   1. Login with your AD credentials. Go to the downloads section.
   2. After downloading, you will need to add the tibcli to your path. If you are on Mac, run `echo $PATH`. Pick one of the directories and place the tibcli file there.
   3. Run `tibcli -v`. Ensure that you don't see any errors.
3. Once you have the prerequisities complete, make a clone of this repository to your local machine.
4. Run `npm install`.
5. In order for BOSS and JEFE Salesforce integrations to work, you will need to add the credentials to your environment variables. The easiest way is to ask another team member for a copy of their .env file. Place the .env file in the top level directory of this project.
6. Run `npm run start` to initialize the project.

## 2. Deploying

Deploying is very simple. Once you are ready to deploy, simply run the following commands

1. `npm run build`
2. `npm run deploy`

If you receive any issues, you will need to login to your user. You can enter your credentials in the prompt, or run `tibcli login` to login manually.
